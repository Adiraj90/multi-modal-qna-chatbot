# 🤖 Multi-Modal QnA Chatbot

The **Multi-Modal QnA Chatbot** is an AI-powered web application built using **Streamlit** and **LangChain**.  
The main feature of this project is **multi-AI provider integration**, which means the chatbot is **not limited to a single AI model**. Users can switch between multiple AI providers such as **Groq, OpenAI, Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, and Ollama (local models)** from the same interface.

The application supports real-world use cases like normal AI chat, context-aware conversations, internet-based QnA, document-based question answering, SQL database querying using natural language, and website content analysis.

## 🤖 AI Providers

The chatbot is designed with **multi-provider AI support**, allowing users to switch between different large language models at runtime without changing the application logic.

### 🔹 OpenAI (Cloud)
- Requires an API key  
- Supports models like **GPT-3.5**, **GPT-4**, and **GPT-4o**  
- Strong reasoning and context handling  
- Best suited for production-grade conversations and complex queries  

### ⚡ Groq (Cloud)
- Requires an API key (free tier available)  
- Ultra-fast inference with low latency  
- Ideal for real-time responses and SQL generation  
- Recommended default provider for speed  

### 🌐 Google Gemini (Cloud)
- Requires an API key  
- Supports **Gemini Pro** and **Gemini 1.5** models  
- Good multimodal and analytical capabilities  

### 🧠 Anthropic Claude (Cloud)
- Requires an API key  
- Known for safer responses and strong reasoning  
- Useful for long-form and structured explanations  

### 🦙 Ollama (Local)
- Runs entirely on the local machine  
- No API key required  
- Supports models like **TinyLlama**, **Llama 3**, **Mistral**  
- Ideal for offline usage, testing, and privacy-focused workflows  

---

## 🎨 Customization & Controls

### 🌡️ Temperature Control
The creativity of responses can be adjusted using the temperature parameter:

- **0.0** → Highly precise and deterministic  
- **0.7** → Balanced and natural conversations (default)  
- **1.0** → More creative and diverse outputs  

### 🧩 Model Selection
- Choose different models within the same provider  
- Switch between providers in real time from the sidebar  
- No application restart required  

This flexibility allows users to experiment with multiple AI models and select the best one for their specific use case.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/multi-modal-qna-chatbot.git
cd multi-modal-qna-chatbot
```

### 2️⃣ Create Virtual Environment

macOS / Linux

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
Windows
```bash 
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```
### 3️⃣ Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### ✅ Create secrets.toml

Create the following file: .streamlit/secrets.toml

Add your API keys:
```toml
OPENAI_API_KEY = "your_openai_key"
GROQ_API_KEY = "your_groq_key"
GOOGLE_API_KEY = "your_google_key"
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = "your_anthropic_key"
TAVILY_API_KEY = "your_tavily_key"
```
### 🚀 Running the Application

After cloning the repository and installing dependencies, the application can be started using:

```bash
streamlit run Home.py
```

## 💡 Use Cases

- 🔍 Ask questions across different AI models from a single interface  
- 📊 Query SQL databases without writing SQL manually  
- 📄 Extract insights from PDFs and text documents  
- 🌐 Analyze website content using AI  
- 🧪 Compare responses from multiple LLM providers  
- 🦙 Run AI locally for privacy-sensitive or offline workflows

## 🔐 Security & Sensitive Files

For security reasons, the following files **must not be pushed to GitHub**:

```text
.streamlit/secrets.toml
```

### 3️⃣ **Why Multi-Provider Design**  
This is the **most important part for interviews**.

Add this section near the top (after Intro or Features):

```markdown
Most chatbots are tightly coupled to a single AI provider.  
This project is designed differently.

- Avoids vendor lock-in  
- Allows real-time provider switching  
- Enables cost and performance comparison  
- Improves reliability if one provider is unavailable  
- Supports both cloud and local AI models  

This architecture makes the chatbot flexible, future-proof, and production-ready.
